# Aplus

An assembly workbench for FreeCAD FC0.19+

This my testfield for creating an assembly workbench based on the experiences during
my development of A2plus.

Design-goals:
- a proper assembly structure within the treevies
- using the link functionality of FC
- adapting some ideas of FreeCAD-Assembly4 WB

More information will follow if my first attempts seem to be succesful.
