# Aplus

An assembly workbench for FreeCAD FC0.19+

This my testfield for creating an assembly workbench based on the experiences during
my development of A2plus.

Do not try to use this workbench for any productive work.
At state now it is only a test framework !

Design-goals:
- a proper assembly structure within the treeview
- using the link functionality of FC
- adapting some ideas of FreeCAD-Assembly4 WB

More information will follow if my first attempts seem to be succesful.

Linux Installation Instructions
-------------------------------
FreeCAD-version of your choice has to be installed before
